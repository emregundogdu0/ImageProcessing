# ImageProcessing
This project uses the Ultralytics YOLOv11n model to detect four custom objects in images: seahorse, pyramid, helicopter, and leopard. The dataset consists of labeled images stored in YOLO format, organized under a fulldata directory with subfolders images/train and labels/train, and configured using a config.yaml file. The training process uses the lightweight yolo11n.pt model and is customized with parameters such as 200 epochs, a batch size of 8, data augmentation options (mosaic, HSV hue adjustment, translation, scaling, rotation), and a learning rate of 0.005. Training outputs are saved in runs/detect/mytrain, including model weights (best.pt, last.pt) and visualizations like loss curves and confusion matrices. After training, inference can be run on new images located in the tumfoto directory. The code uses the ultralytics Python package and can run on either CPU or GPU. The modelâ€™s performance and logs are automatically saved, and validation is done using the training set if a separate validation set is not provided. This setup demonstrates an efficient custom object detection pipeline suitable for lightweight real-time applications.
